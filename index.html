   <h1><center><u>NARA CHANDRA BABU NAIDU</u></center></h1> 
   <p><b>Nara Chandrababu Naidu</b> (born 20 April 1950), also known as Chandrababu Naidu or CBN, is an Indian politician and the current Leader of Opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly. He also served as Chief Minister from 1995 to 2004 and as Opposition Leader from 2004 to 2014 of Andhra Pradesh. He is the National President of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).[2] He suffered a major political set back in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly Elections where he won only 23 seats out of the total 175 seats.[3]

    Chandrababu Naidu was one of the most recognised Chief Ministers in the country during his nine-and-a-half-year tenure from 1995 to 2004.[4] He was a strong supporter of liberalisation policies at the state level.[5] The western media hailed him as "one of the most promising local leaders not just in India but in the developing world."[6] Andhra Pradesh was the first state in India to receive a direct World Bank loan for economic restructuring.[7] Naidu was a regular participant at World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland.[8]He is credited with commissioning HITEC City, and Genome Valley in 1998 by the erstwhile combined Government of Andhra Pradesh, adjoining Cyberabad to the west of Hyderabad, propelling the information technology industry and enhancing modern infrastructure in Hyderabad, including the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport and the Indian School of Business (ISB).[9] Naidu's meetings with Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, in New Delhi in 1997, followed by Gates' visit to Hyderabad in 2002,[10] and the visit of US President Bill Clinton in 2000,[11] played a significant role in enhancing his reputation.[12]

    During his third term between 2014 and 2019, Naidu took up the ambitious project of building a capital city Amaravati for the bifurcated state.[13] Andhra Pradesh also became the number one state in Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) Rankings during this period.[14</p>

    <p>Naidu started his political activities as a student' union leader in Sri Venkateswara University while pursuing his master's degree. In 1975, he joined Indian Youth Congress and became the president of its local chapter in Pulicherla. After the emergency was imposed on the country in 1975, he became a supporter of Sanjay Gandhi.[22]

        With the help of N. G. Ranga, Naidu secured a candidacy from the Congress party, under its 20% quota for the youth, and became a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the Chandragiri constituency in 1978 assembly elections. He initially served as a director of Andhra Pradesh Small Scale Industries Development Corporation. Later, he was appointed as a minister in T. Anjaiah's government. Between 1980 and 1983, Naidu held various portfolios, including archives, cinematography, technical education, and minor irrigation in the state government.[23] He became the youngest MLA at the age of 28 and a minister at the age of 30 in Andhra Pradesh at that time.
        
        As the cinematography minister, Naidu came in contact with N. T. Rama Rao, a popular film star in Telugu cinema. In September 1981, he married Bhuvaneswari, Rao's second daughter.[24]Naidu, soon after the assassination attempt on him, dissolved the state assembly. Elections to the state were held along with the parliamentary polls in April 2004. The TDP government faced anti-incumbency fuelled by high power tariffs and the absence of support to the agricultural sector. Besides, the newly formed Congress(I)-TRS alliance posed a major challenge to the TDP popularity in Telangana.[44] The Telugu Desam Party was defeated in both the state and Lok Sabha elections. The Congress Party won 185 seats while the TDP ended up with 47 seats in the assembly, the lowest in the party's electoral history. TDP won only 5 seats out of 42 in Parliament. Naidu felt that the severe drought that gripped Andhra Pradesh the previous year as well as advancing the timing of the election were the major reasons for his ‘shock’ defeat.[45]</p>
